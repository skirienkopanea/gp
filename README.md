# Install instructions

To play unzip the client file of your OS and run Garden.exe on windows or cd into the directory and run on Linux:

```
./Garden.sh
```

You can host a dedicated server on linux by unzipping the server file and running in the relevant directory:

```
./GardenServer.sh
```

To host games, either as client by clicking host or per the dedicated server executable, you need to have port `7777` open.

You don't have to append the port to the IP Address of a server, i.e.the following addresses are correct examples:

* Local host: `127.0.0.1`
* Sample local IP Address: `192.168.1.10`
* Domain name address: `kpan.nl`
